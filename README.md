# Network Analysis - ITU 2021 - Group 10

This repository contains the code and data regarding the project in the Network Analysis course at ITU.
The project analyses a crime network...

### Data
The data is a bipartite network of associations between suspects, victims and/or witnesses of crimes in St. Louis in the 1990's. Left nodes represent a person and right nodes represent a crime. Edges connect a person to an invidual crime. Metadata includes names, genders and category of the edge (suspect, victim, witness).

Data are derived from police records, via snowball sampling from five initial homicides.

There are 1380 nodes and 1476 edges in the network.
